## Tokens

Refresh tokens and access tokens are both used in authentication and authorization systems, but they serve different purposes and have distinct characteristics:

## Access Tokens:
Access tokens are short-lived tokens issued by the authentication server after a user successfully logs in or authenticates.
They are used to access protected resources or APIs on behalf of the authenticated user.
Access tokens typically have a short expiration time, ranging from minutes to hours, to reduce the risk of unauthorized access if they are compromised.
Once an access token expires, the client must obtain a new one by re-authenticating with the authentication server.

## Refresh Tokens:
- Refresh tokens are long-lived tokens also issued by the authentication server during the initial authentication process.
- They are used to obtain new access tokens without requiring the user to re-enter their credentials.
- Refresh tokens have a longer expiration time compared to access tokens, ranging from days to months.
- When an access token expires, the client can use a refresh token to request a new access token from the authentication server without prompting the user for their credentials again.

- In summary, access tokens are short-lived tokens used to access protected resources, while refresh tokens are long-lived tokens used to obtain new access tokens without re-authenticating the user. Refresh tokens are useful for maintaining user sessions and reducing the frequency of user logins while maintaining security by limiting the lifespan of access tokens. However, they also introduce additional security considerations, such as the need to securely store and manage refresh tokens to prevent unauthorized access.
